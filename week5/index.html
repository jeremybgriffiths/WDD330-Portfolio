    <h1>Week 5</h1>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <h3>Testing and Debugging</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Strict mode is recommended to create better code. Place all code in self-invoking function.</li>
        <li>EvalError is not used in the current ECMAScript specification and only retained for backwards compatibility.
            It was used to identify errors when using the global eval() function. </li>
        <li>RangeError is thrown when a number is outside an allowable range of values.</li>
        <li>ReferenceError is thrown when a reference is made to an item that doesn’t exist. For example, calling a
            function that hasn't been defined.</li>
        <li>SyntaxError is thrown when there’s an error in the code’s syntax.</li>
        <li>TypeError is thrown when there’s an error in the type of value used; for example, a string is used when a
            number is expected.</li>
        <li>URIError is thrown when there’s a problem encoding or decoding the URI.</li>
        <li>InternalError is a non-standard error that is thrown when an error occurs in the JavaScript engine. A common
            cause of this too much recursion.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Code Examples</h2>
    <code>
        (function() { <br>
        'use strict'; <br>
        // All your code would go inside this function <br>
        }()); <br>
    </code> <br>
