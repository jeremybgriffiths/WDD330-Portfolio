    <h3>AJAX</h3>
    <p>
        Ajax allows users to see new content on web pages without having to refresh the page.
        This is done by making calls that are asynchronous. The XMLHttpRequest object was standardized
        in HTML5, but it has been superceded by the Fetch API which is the current standard for
        requesting and sending data asynchronously.
    </p>
    <h3>Code Example</h3>
    <code>
        fetch('https://example.com/data') <br>
            .then( // code that handles the response ) <br>
            .catch( // code that runs if the server returns an error ) <br>
    </code> <br>
